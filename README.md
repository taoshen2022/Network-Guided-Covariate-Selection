# Network-Guided Covariate Selection

## Overview
This repository presents an extension of the study "Network-Guided Covariate Selection and Related Problems on High-Dimensional Data", providing code for both simulation studies and real-world network analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To prepare for the experiments, ensure all required packages listed in "requirements.txt" are installed.

### Run experiments (below are some examples)
```
Rscript ./Simultion/DCSBM-1.R
Rscript ./Simultion/RDPG-1.R
```
## Reproducing our Figures

To reproduce the figures presented in the paper, follow these steps:

1. Run the Experiments: Execute the scripts in "Simulation" and "Real network analysis" directories.
2. Save Results: Store the output as specified in the script instructions.
3. Generate Visualizations: Execute the corresponding visualization scripts to create the figures.
